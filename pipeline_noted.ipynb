A good usecase for this is if you have good landmark (e.g blood vessels) in the field of view and want to `estimate_shifts` only on those region of interest. Note that if you are running in interactive mode (`interactive = True`), there is an interactive viewer later to help you find proper `subset_mc`. Both `subset` and `subset_mc` should be specified as python [dictionary](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries), whose `keys` are the dimension along which subsetting should be done, and `values` specify how subsetting should be done (usually a [slice object](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/slice.html)). If the word \"dimension\" and how data are indexed are confusing, move on to the section where the data structure are discussed.\n",
    "* `in_memory` specify whether to load the whole dataset into memory.\n",

In real situation you would probably want `in_memory = True` as well if your data can fit in the memory.\n",

    "Alternatively you can try using [anisotropic diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropic_diffusion). This is inspired by [MIN1PIPE](https://github.com/JinghaoLu/MIN1PIPE) package. Refer to [the paper](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)30826-X) for full detail. In a nutshell, gaussian blur can be think of as a diffusion process - that is, imagine your grey-scale image represent the concentration of some molecule, say saline, in a two dimesional dish, letting the saline diffuse for some time would be equivalent to carrying out a gaussian blur on the original image/concentration, and longer diffusion time correspond to gaussian blur with larger standard deviation. Anisotropic diffusion is a generalization of this idea - instead of diffusing uniformly, it make the diffusion slower where the gradient is higher. The result is a diffusion/denoising process that preserve the edges, and in theory is more favorable than gaussian blur. That said, `niter` is the number of iteration of this process, in other words, the \"time-step\" the diffusion is gonna last. The larger this number, the more blurred the image is gonna be. Pragmatically `niter=10` is good enought. Note that increasing this number will significantly increase the computation time since there more iterative steps for every frame. `kappa` decides who gets treated as \"edges\" and thus preserved. Pixels whose gradient is much larger than this number will diffuse much slower, whereas pixels with gradient lower than `kappa` will just flow. As mentioned before, pragmatically we found estimating `kappa` with the 90-th percentile of the gradient of an example frame works well. `gamma` control the speed of diffusion. In theory we want this as large as possible to save some `niter` and thus computation time. However it is advised to set this no larger than **0.25** otherwise weird things might happen. There were two equations that were proposed to control the diffusion process in the [original paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=78304) of anisotropic diffusion, and `option` controls which one to use. Pragmatically `option=2` works better. For full control of the process, refer to the [documentation](http://loli.github.io/medpy/generated/medpy.filter.smoothing.anisotropic_diffusion.html)."

    "The idea behind `estimate_shift_fft` is simple: for each frame it calculates a two-dimensional [cross-correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation) between that frame and a template using [fft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform). The argument `'dim'` specify along which dimension to run the shift estimation, and should always be left `'frame'` for this pipeline. The argument `on` determine what we should use as template, it can be the first frame `on='first'`, the last frame `on='last'`, the mean frame `on='mean'`, or `on='perframe'`, meaning every frame will be registered to the immediate previous frame instead of a common template. After we have obtained the [cross-correlogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlogram) for each frame, in theory we can simply look at the place/shift that has maximum correlation and use the inverse of that as `shifts`. However, due to some mysterious property of miniscope data, the maximum of the correlogram are usually biased towards weird places, most likely somewhere close to origin ((0, 0) shifts), and it's more reliable to use the [center_of_mass](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.16.1/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.measurements.center_of_mass.html) of the correlogram rather than simply [argmax](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.1/reference/generated/numpy.argmax.html). There is yet another gotcha -- there are usually other local maximas that will bias `center_of_mass` and it's better to threshold those out before we take the `center_of_mass`. The argument `pct_thres` controls that -- it will set any value below that percentile to 0 in the cross-correlogram. Pragmatically `pct_thres=99.9` works well at taking out all the weird artifacts. The results from `estimate_shift_fft` are saved in a two dimensional `DataArray` called `res`, with three different `variable`s: the shifts along `'height'`, the shifts along `'width'`, and the actuall value of maximum correlation `corr`. And we have these three `variable`s across all `frame`s (hence the two dimensions). We can thus pull out `shifts` and `corr`s from `res`."

    "Sometimes there are frames in the video that has a horrible shift and is simply way off the common field-of-view. For these frames it is not a good idea to shift them based on cross-correlation. Instead they should be treated as data loss and discarded/interpolated. `mask_shifts` tries to address this by simply look at the maximum correlations that is saved during `estimate_shift_fft`. The idea is if some frame has a way lower cross-correlation to template comparing to other frames, they are likely to be very bad frames. `mask_shifts` takes four required arguments: `varr_fft` which is the fft-transformed video arrays. `corr` which are the values of maximum correlations. `shifts` which are the shifts in both directions. All three of these comes from `estimate_shift_fft`. The fourth one `z_thres` gets to decide who is the \"bad\" frame -- the `corr`s will be z-scored, then any frame whose z-transformed `corr` is lower than `z_thres` would be treated as \"bad\" frames and interpolated. Another optional argument is `perframe`, it's a boolean value specifying whether `estimate_shift_fft` was carried out per-frame. If `perframe=True`, in addition to taking out \"bad\" frames, it will also recalculate the shifts of the two most adjacent \"good\" frames based on each other, that is, ignoring the \"bad\" frames who just got taken out. Obviously only set `perframe=True` if `on='perframe'` for `estimate_shift_fft`.

    "This step try to estimate backgrounds frame by frame and remove them. As with last step, the first argument to `remove_backgroun` is `varr` which is the video array to be processed, and the second is the `method` to use. Again there are two methods available: `'uniform'` or `'tophat'`. For both of them, they require a single parameter - a window size `wnd`, which is the third required argument to `remove_background`. The two methods differ in how background is estimated. For `method='uniform'`, a [uniform filter](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.19.0/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.uniform_filter.html) (basically a two dimensional rolling mean) is applied to each frame. `wnd` control the window size of the filter, and the result is used as the background. The idea is that backgrounds mainly contains out-of-focus fluorescence, that is basicly a super-blurred version of the image itself. Thus a large (comparing to the expected size of a cell) number of `wnd` should work well. Pragmatically **50** works pretty good. For `method='tophat'`, a [disk element](http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.morphology.html#disk) with a radius of `wnd` is created, then a [morphological erosion](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/erode.htm) using the disk element is applied to each frame, which eats away any bright \"features\" that is smaller than the disk element. Then, a [morphological dilation](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/dilate.htm) is applied to the \"eroded\" image, which in theory undo the erosion except the bright \"features\" that are completely eaten away will not be recovered. The overall effect of this process is to remove any bright feature that is smaller than a disk with radius `wnd`. Thus, when setting `wnd` to the expected size of **largest** cell, this process can give us a good estimation of the background. Pragmatically `wnd=10` works pretty well. The computation time of `method='tophat'` is significantly longer than `method='uniform'`, but the result is also visually much more appealing. Lastly, regardless of which `method` is chosen, `remove_background` will subtract the estimated background from the original movie frame by frame."

The assumption here is that the center of cells have to be brighter than it's surroundings on some, but not necessarily all, frames. The first and only required argument `seeds_init` takes is `varr` -- the video array we want to process. There are four additional arguments controlling how we subset the frames: `wnd_size` controls the window size of each chunk, *i.e* the number of frames in each chunk; `method` can be either `'rolling'` or `'random'`. For `method='rolling'`, the moving window will roll along `frame`, whereas for `method='random'`, chunks with `wnd_size` number of frames will be randomly pick; `stp_size` is only used if `method='rolling'`, it is the step-size of the rolling windows, in other words the distance between the **center** of each rolling window. For example, if `wnd_size=100` and `stp_size=200`, the windows will be like: **(0, 50)**, **(150, 250)**, **(350, 450)** *etc.* (Obviously that was a bad choice since you probably want the windows to overlap otherwise you will miss cells); `nchunk` is only used if `method='random'`, It is the number of random chunks we will draw. The default values of `seeds_init` usually works fairly well."

If we put those peak-to-valley values for all the seeds together and look at the histogram of those values, they are supposed to be composed of two Gaussian distribution. We then fit a Gaussian Mixture Model of two components to those peak-to-valley values, and ask the model to predict for each value which Gaussian distribution it is likely to come from. We then keep only the seeds whose peak-to-valley value come from the Gaussian distribution with higher mean, that is, relatively large among all seeds. Thus the assumption here is that of all the \"bright\" seeds we have pulled out from the video, some of them barely changed their fluoresence across the whole recording session, while others changed a lot. Those who changes are cells whereas those who don't are weird random bright-spots. It can be speculated that if a cell was firing all the time during recording, they might be filtered out during this step. In that case you might want to skip this step. `gmm_refine` takes in the video array `varr`, the `seeds` to be refined, and an optional arguments: `q` control how we define \"peak\" and \"valley\". By default `q=(0.1, 99.9)` meaning we use **0.1** percentile as the \"valley\" and **99.9** percentile as the \"peak\"; `n_components` and `valide_components` collectively determine how gaussian model are fit and selected: `n_components` is the number of components/gaussian kernel, and `valid_components` is the number of gaussian kernels that is considered the \"signal\" gaussian -- they are counted from the right, that is, they always have higher mean. `mean_mask` determine whether an additional criteria should be used to select seeds: in addition to being predicted to belong to the \"signal\" gaussian kernels, the peak-to-valley values of the seeds also has to be higher than the smallest mean of all gaussian kernels. This is helpful especially when `n_components` is low but you have different types of trash seeds, and sometimes since the majority of trash seeds compose a really narrow gaussian, the few outlier trash seeds that has very low peak-to-valley value might be falsely classified as signals. Usually it is fine to leave them as-is, but feel free to change them if you believe they are messing things up."

It seem to be the most complicated chunk of code so far, but it is very important to read through it, since we will see similar things later and it is a very powerful piece of code that can help you visualize a lot of stuff.

We will go line by line: First we create a `list` of frequencies we want to try out -- `noise_freq_list`. The \"frequency\" values here is a proportion of your sampling rate. Then we randomly selected 6 seeds from `seeds_gmm` and call them `example_seeds`, which in turn help us pull out the temporal traces from the movie `Y_flt`, which are assigned to `example_trace`. We then create an empty dictionary `smooth_dict` to store the resulting visualizations. Then there is the `for` loop iterating through `noise_freq_list`, with one of the values from the list as `freq` during each iteration. Within the loop, we run `smooth_sig` twice on `example_trace` with the current `freq` we are testing out. The low-passed result is assigned to `trace_smth_low`, while the high-pass result is assigned to `trace_smth_high`. Then we make sure to actually carry-out the computation by calling the `compute` method on the resulting `DataArray`s. Finally, we turn the two traces into visualizations: we construct [hv.Curve](http://holoviews.org/reference/elements/bokeh/Curve.html)s from them and put them in an container called [hv.HoloMap](http://holoviews.org/reference/containers/bokeh/HoloMap.html). Again if you are confused about how the visualization works, it's time to check out [the tutorial](http://holoviews.org/getting_started/Introduction.html). After that we store the whole visualization into `smooth_dict`, with the keys being the `freq` and values corresponding to the result of this iteration."

First we seperate/filter the temporal signal for each seed based on frequency -- the signals composed of the lower half of the frequency are regarded as **real** signals, while the higher half of the frequency are presumably **noise** (\"half\" being relative to [Nyquist frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency)). Then we take the peak-to-valley value (really just **max** minus **min**, or, [np.ptp](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.1/reference/generated/numpy.ptp.html)) for both the **real** signal and **noise** signal. Then finally, \"peak-to-noise ratio\" is simply the ratio between the `np.ptp` values of **real** and **noise** signal. So, the critical assumption here is that real activities are lower frequency while noise are higher frequency, and they seperate at approximately half the Nyquist frequency, or, one-fourth of the sampling frequency of the video, and we don't want those \"seeds\" whose **real** signals are buried in **noise**. If these assumptions does not suit your case, for example, if you have a really low sampling rate, or if your video are unavoidably noisy, consider skipping this step. As always, `pnr_refine` takes in `varr` and `seeds` as first two arguments, then the `noise_freq` that best separate signal and noise, which hopefully has been determined from previous cells, and a `thres`, where seeds whose \"peak-to-noise ratio\" fall below this threshold will be discarded. Pragmatically `thres=1` works fine and makes sense. You can also use `thres='auto'`, where again a gaussian mixture model of 2 components will be runned on the peak-to-noise ratios and seeds will be selected if they belong to the \"higher\" gaussian."

We then use those bins to generate a [histogram](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.1/reference/generated/numpy.histogram.html), and find the bin that has the highest frequency/density. Then the threshold is simply twice the intensity that correspond to the highest bin. `intensity_refine` only takes `varr` and `seeds` with no additional arguments. It can, however, potentially run into problems: In case you have a field-of-view that is bright overall, the threshold might simply be out of the range of the intensities. In that case `intensity_refine` simply do nothing (and it will tell you if that happens). Pragamatically that rarely happens and `intensity_refine` usually does not take away real cells.

    "The idea is simple: for each seeds, their fluorescence level on all frames should be somewhat [bimodal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal_distribution), with a large normal distribution representing silence/little activities, and maybe a tiny peak representing when the seed/cell is firing. Thus we can carry out KS test for all seeds against the normal distribution, and keep only the seeds where the null hypothesis (that the fluoresence is simply a normal distribution) is rejected and is defaulted to **0.05**. `ks_refine` takes in `varr` and `seeds` as first two arguments, then a `sig` which is the significance level at which the null hypothesis is rejected. Personally I found this step tend to take away real cells when the video is very short (for example, the one that comes with this package under `\"./demo_movies\"`), probably because the number of \"active\" frames are too small comparing to the majority of the frames. So feel free to skip this step if you encounter the same situation."

In addition, it's very beneficial to smooth the signals before running the correlation, and again `noise_freq` determines how the smooth should be done. In addition to feeding a number, you can also use `noise_freq='envelope'` so that a hilbert transform will be runned on the temporal traces of each seeds and the correlation will be calculated on the envelope signal. Any pair of seeds that are within `thres_dist` **and** has a correlation higher than `thres_corr` will be merged together, where \"merge\" meaning only the seed with maximum internsity in the max projection of the video will be kept.

Let `sd` denote the temporal activity of the seed, we use the dot product of the temporal activities between the seed and the surrounding pixels `sur.dot(sd)` normalized by the [Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)) of `sur`: [np.linalg.norm(sur)](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.1/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.norm.html), as well as `np.linalg.norm(sd)`, as the spatial footprint `a`. In the form of equation: $$\\mathbf{a} = \\frac{\\mathbf{sur} \\cdot \\mathbf{sd}}{\\Vert{\\mathbf{sur}}\\Vert \\Vert{\\mathbf{sd}}\\Vert}$$ We can think of this as a normalized measurement of how similar the temporal activities of each surrounding pixel is comparing to those of the seed. Then we use the dot product `sur.dot(a)` as the temporal trace for the seed, which is conceptually an \"averaged\" activities of all the pixels surrounding the seed weighted by `a`. After that we simply [concatenate](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.concat.html) the spatial footprints and temporal traces from different seeds together along a new dimension `unit_id` to get our initial `A` and `C` matrix. Finally we need two more terms: `b` and `f` representing the spatial footprint and temporal dynamic of the **background**, respectively. We find those by simply taking the dot product `A.dot(C)`, which is the activities from our initial units, and subtract that from the original movie `varr`. We use the mean of that remainder across `frame` as `b`, and the mean across `height` and `width` as `f`. `initilaize` takes in `varr` and `seeds` as the first two arguments. Two additional arguments determine how we find the `sur`roundings when calculating `a`. Firstly we certainly do not want to consider every other pixels in the movie as `sur` to a seed, and we just need a hard window where any pixels outside that window are ignored during the calculation of `a`. `wnd` is the half-size of that window. Secondly, not every pixels within the range of `wnd` are equally possible to be part of the cell represented by the seed. We thus put another correlation threshold -- pixels whose temporal activities has a pearson correlation with the seed higher than `thres_corr` will be considered as `sur`."

    "This section assume you already have good knowledge about using CNMF as a method of extracting neural activities from the movie. If not, please read [the paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627315010843) before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a quick reminder and check, here is the essential idea of CNMF: We believe our movie `Y`, with dimension `height`, `width` and `frame`, can be written in (and thus break down as) the following equation: $$\\mathbf{Y} = \\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{C} + \\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{f} + \\epsilon$$ where `A` is the spatial footprint of each unit, with dimension `height`, `width` and `unit_id`, and `C` is the temporal activities of each unit, with dimension `unit_id` and `frame`. `b` and `f` are the spatial footpring and temporal activities of some background, and $\\epsilon$ is the noise. Note that strictly speaking, matrix multiplication are usually only defined for two dimensional matrices, but our `A` here has three dimensions. So in fact we are taking the [tensor product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product) of `A` and `C`, reducing the dimension `unit_id`. This might seem to complicate things (comparing to just treat `height` and `width` as one flattened `spatial` dimension), but I believe it help you understand the essence of why the equation make sense: when you take a dot product of any two \"matrices\" on certain **dimension**, all that is happening is a **product** followed by a **sum** -- you take the product for all pairs of matching numbers coming from the two \"matrices\", where \"match\" is defined by their index along the said dimension, and then you take the sum of all those products along the dimension. Thus when we take the tensor product of `A` and `C`, we are actually multiplying all those numbers in dimension `height`, `width` and `frame`, matched by `unit_id`, and then take the sum. Conceptually, for each unit, we are weighting the spatial footprint (`height` and `width`) by the fluorecense of that unit on given `frame`, which is the **product**, and then we are overlaying all units together, which is the **sum**. With that, the equation above is trying to say that our movie is made up of a weighted sum of the spatial footprint and temporal activities of all units, plus some background and noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, there is another rule about `C` that separate it from background and noise, and save it from being just some random matrix that happen to fit well with the data `Y` without having any biological meaning, and that is the second essential idea of CNMF: each \"row\" of `C`, which is the temporal trace for each unit, should be described as an [autoregressive process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_model)(AR process), with a parameter `p` defining the **order** of the AR process: $$ c(t) = \\sum_{i=0}^{p}\\gamma_i c(t-i) + s(t) + \\epsilon$$ where $c(t)$ is the calcium concentration at time (`frame`) $t$, $s(t)$ is spike/firing rate at time $t$ (what we actually care), and $\\epsilon$ is again some noise. Basicly this equation is trying to say that at any given time $t$, the calcium concentration at that moment $c(t)$ depends on the spike at that moment $s(t)$, as well as its own history up to `p` time-step back $c(t-i)$, scaled by some parameters $\\gamma_i$s, plus some noise $\\epsilon$. Another intuition of this equation come from looking at different `p`s: when `p=0`, calcium concentration is an exact copy of the spiking activities, which is probably not true; when `p=1`, calcium concentration is an exponential decay with instant rise triggered by the spikes; when `p=2`, calcium concentration is an exponential decay that has some rising time; when `p>2`, more convoluted waveforms start to emerge. (all of these with some noise, of course)\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, all CNMF is doing is trying to find the `A` and `C` (along with `b` and `f`) that best describe `Y`. There are two more important practical concerns: Firstly we cannot solve this problem in one shot, we need to iteratively and separately update `A` and `C` to approach the true solution, and we need something to start with (that is what **initilization** section is about). Surprisingly often times 2 iterative steps seem to give us good enough results, but you can always add more iterations (and you should be ablt to easily do that after reading the comments); Secondly, by intuition you may define \"best describe `Y`\" as the results that minimize the noise $\\epsilon$ (or residule, if you will). However we have to control for the [sparsity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) of our results as well, since we do not want every little random pixel that happen to correlate with a cell to be counted as part of the spatial footprint of the cell (non-sparse `A`), nor do we want a tiny spike at every frame trying to explain every noisy peak we observe (non-sparse `C`). Thus the balance between fidelity (minimizing error) and sparsity (minimizing non-zero entries) is an important idea for both the spatial and temporal update."

However updating that amount of numbers in `A` is still computationally very demanding, and it is much better if we can breakdown the big problem into smaller chunks so that we can parallelize them. **CNMF** is all about solving the issues caused by overlapping neurons, so it is best to keep the dependency along `unit_id` and update those entries together. However, it is totally fine to treat each pixel as independent and update different pixels separately (in parallel). Thus, our new \"smaller\" problem is: for each pixel, find the corresponding pixel in `A` across all `unit_id` that gives us smallest **l1-norm** as well as smallest **error** when multiplied by `C`. In equation, this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "& \\underset{A_{ij}}{\\text{minimize}}\n",

    "& \\text{subject to}\n",
    "& & A_{ij} \\geq 0 \n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we use $A_{ij}$ to represent one pixel in `A` like `A.sel(height=i, width=j)`, which will only have one dimension `unit_id` left. Similarly $Y_{ij}$ is the corresponding pixel in `Y` which only have one dimension `frame` left. Thus $\\left \\lVert Y_{ij} - A_{ij} \\cdot C \\right \\rVert ^2$ is our **error** term and $\\left \\lvert A_{ij} \\right \\rvert$ is our **l1-norm**, and we are finally putting them together as one goal, with an $\\alpha$ controlling the balance between them. So the higher the $\\alpha$, the more contribution the **l1-norm** term make to the common goal (target function), the more penalty/emphasis you are putting on sparsity, and as a result the more sparse `A` would become. The determination of the exact value of $\\alpha$ is rather complicated, but the parameter we have for `update_spatial` is relative, where `alpha=1` correspond to the default behavior of **CaImAn** package, and is usually a good place to start testing. Pragmatically, relatively small value of `sparse_penal` has very little impact on the resulting `A`, but once you hit a large enough value, you will start to see units getting dimmer, sometimes completely disappear when you do [the parameter exploring](#test-parameters-for-spatial-update). You might think that is sparsity penalty in action, but from experience this is usually the case you want to **avoid**, since after all `update_spatial` has no way to differentiate noise from cells other than their corresponding temporal trace, thus you do not want it to take out cells for you unless you absolutely trust the temporal traces (which you shouldn't for now since it's the first update and the temporal trace we have are merely some weighted mean of the original movie)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is yet another parameter `dl_wnd` that is related to a practical consideration: recall that we are updating $A_{ij}$ for our \"small\" problem, which has the dimension `unit_id` and has `A.sizes['unit_id]` number of entries in them (that is, the number of units you have). This is computationally feasible, but still a lot, especially when you do this to all the pixels. One way to reduce the computational demands is to leave out certain units when updating certain pixels -- it does not make sense to consider a unit that is supposed to be at the top left corner of the field of view when we update a pixel in bottom right corner. In other words, for each pixel, we solve the \"small\" problem with only a subset of all the potential units, thus hugely increase the speed of `update_spatial`. This is where `A_init` comes into play (actually the only place it is used -- we do not need `A` at all for the update itself). We compute a morphological dilation that is used during [background removal](#background-removal) on `A_init`, unit by unit, with window size `dl_wnd`, and we use the result as a **masking matrix**, so that during the actual update of any given pixel, only the unit that has a non-zero value at the corresponding pixel in the **masking matrix** will be considered for updating. In other words, we are allowing each unit to expand from `A_init` up to a distance of `dl_wnd`, and kill off any possibility beyond that range, since they will not be considered for update with those pixels outside the **masking matrix**. We can again use the expected size of cell as `dl_wnd`, the rationale would be even, for some reason, we have only one non-zero pixel representing the center of certain unit in `A_init`, that unit can potentially expand to a full size cell, but anything beyond that would probably be either part of other cell or random noise. Obviously after `update_spatial`, if you find you units being cut-off abruptly and seem to be not able to expand enough, try increasing `dl_wnd`. If you do not like this feature and feel happy with the full scale computation, setting `dl_wnd=None` or `dl_wnd=0` will turn off the masking completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we have a boolean parameter `update_background` controlling whether we want to update the background in this step. This is the only place in the pipeline that the background will be updated, and essentially the way it is updated is simply treating `b` as another `unit` and update it according to the temporal activity `f`. Pragmatically since the morphology-based [background removal](#backgroun-removal) works so well at cleaning the backgrounds, this updating has little impact on the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the actual implementation of the optimization method, it is hard for the computer to set some variable to absolutely zero. Instead we usually have a very small float number at the place that should be zero. `zero_thres` solve this by thresholding all the values and set anything below `zero_thres` to zero. Apparently you want to use a very small number for `zero_thres`. Setting `zero_thres='eps'` will use the [machine epsilon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_epsilon)(the smallest non-negative number a machine can represent) of current datatype.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we have an additional step after everything: a post-hoc scaling. The rationale for this is that since we are using **l1-norm** as one of the term to be minimized, we can mistakenly reduce the amplitude of some number to a very small extend. Thus we try to scale them back after the optimization step by assigning a single scaling factor to each `unit`, and the values of scaling factors are found simply by least-square when regressing the scaled version of `A` with the original `Y` averaged across `frame`. The boolean parameter `post_scal` controls whether this scaling process should be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "`update_spatial` takes in the original data `Y`, the initial spatial footprint for units and background `A` and `b` respectively, the initial temporal trace for units and background `C` and `f` respectively, and the estimated noise on each pixel `sn`, in that order. Optional arguments are `sparse_penal`, `dl_wnd`, `update_background`, `post_scal` and `zero_thres` which we have already discussed."

    "just like spatial update, given `A`, our goal is to find the `C` that minimize both the **error** (`Y - A.dot(C, 'unit_id')`) and **l1-norm** of `C`. However there is an additional constraint: the trace of each unit in `C` must follow the autoregressive process. Due to this additional layer of complexity, everything becomes more computationaly expensive, and we have to do more to reduce the computation cost. The first observation is that `A` is usually much larger than `C` (you usually have more total pixels than `frame`s), and doing a dot product `A.dot(C, 'unit_id')` everytime you try a different number in `C` can easily go crazy. Thus we want to leverage this burden by converting our **error** term to something like $\\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{C}$, where $\\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ represent a matrix that can \"undo\" what `A` usually do to `C` -- instead of weighting the temporal activity of each unit by spatial footprint (converting a matrix with dimension `unit_id` and `frame` into one with `height`, `width` and `frame`), $\\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ \"extract\" the temporal activities of each unit based on their spatial footprint (convert a matrix with dimension `height`, `width` and `frame` into one with dimension `unit_id` and `frame`), in other words, almost like an [inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore–Penrose_inverse) of `A`. This way, we only need to calculate $\\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathbf{Y}$ once and be done -- we can use that result everytime we update `C`. The calculation of $\\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathbf{Y}$ is rather complicated and not strictly mathematically accurate, but it provide a good approximation with huge computational benefit and is the default behavior of CaImAn. You can turn this off by supplying `use_spatial=True`, however that is usually too computationally demanding to do practically. We will assume `use_spatial=False` in the following discussion and call the $\\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathbf{Y}$ term `YrA` as in the code. The second observation we have about computational complexity is that we can no longer keep the `unit_id` dimension and chop up `frame` dimension for parallel processing (like what we did for spatial update, except we chopped up pixels that time), since we have to check whether each trace along the `frame` dimension follow the autoregressive process this time. So unfortunately we have to turn to the `unit_id` dimension to make our problem \"smaller\". Since we have a relatively good `A` now, it should be OK to update units that are not spatially overlapping independently. This idea should work if you have a relatively sparse distribution of cells. However if your field-of-view is packed with cells, like during an imaging of hippocampus, and we consider cells overlap with each other if ther share more than one pixels, we will likely ended up updating the whole `C` altogether anyway since every cell is transitively overlapping with every other cell. So we need to put an threshold on how we define \"overlap\", and that is what `jac_thres` for -- only the cells that share their area of spatial footprint more than this threshold (ranging from 0 to 1) will be considered \"overlapping\". (the \"proportion of overlapping area\" has a formal name [Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index), hence the name `jac_thres`). Pragamatically `jac_thres=0.2` works for data that is very compact in cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now turn to the \"other layer of complexity\" which is the autoregressive process. Recall that the temporal trace of each unit should be fitted by the following equation: $$c(t) = \\sum_{i=0}^{p}\\gamma_i c(t-i) + s(t) + \\epsilon$$ The first thing we want to determine is `p`. As discussed before, `p=2` is a good choice if your calcium transients has an observable rising time. `p=1` might work better if the rising time is so fast comparing to your sampling rate that you want to ignore it. `p` more than 3 might give you issues of [over-fitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting) and is generally not recomended unless you are certain that your calcium traces appear to have a more complicated waveform that cannot be accounted for by a rise and decay. Next, notice that we have a bunch of $\\gamma_i$s unaccounted for (usually not that much denpending on the `p` you choose). Luckily we do not have to iteratively update those -- it turns out that the $\\gamma_i$s of an autoregressive process has certain relationship with the [autocovariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocovariance) functions of the signal with with different lags, which can be readily computed from `YrA`. For full derivation of those relationships please refer to the [original CNMF paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627315010843?via%3Dihub). Here we can just speculate that the parameters that affect how much a signal depends on its own history must have some relationship with the covariance of the signal when you shift itself with different lags. So $\\gamma_i$s can be computed rather deterministicly. Say you choose `p=2` and thus you have two $\\gamma_i$s to be estimated, you would need exactly two equations involving the autocovariance function up to 2 time-step lags to give you the two $\\gamma_i$s. However you can keep adding in more equations, since the impact of $\\gamma_i$s can extend infinitely back in time and should be refelected in autocovariance functions with all those additional lags. Then you have an [overdetermined system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdetermined_system) which, in an ideal world, would just give you the one true answer of the two $\\gamma_i$s that satisfy all those equations. In reality nothing adds up perfectly and we solve those equations with [least squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares). Thus it is important to choose an appropriate number of **additional** equations, which is what `add_lag` control. An `add_lag` that is too small like `add_lag=0` will leave everything to the first `p` number of equations and autocovariance functions, which might not be reliable. Pragmatically I found smaller value of `add_lag` tends to bias the $\\gamma_i$s to give a much faster decay, whereas larger `add_lag` tend to give a longer decay. As a rule of thumb it is usually good to set `add_lag` to approximately the decay time of your signal (in frames). Once we determined the $\\gamma_i$s, the calcium traces $c(t)$ and spikes $s(t)$ are essentially **one thing** -- given calcium traces and how they rise/decay in response to spikes, we can deduce where the spikes happens, and *vice versa*. We can express this determined relationship with a matrix $\\mathbf{G}$ where $s(t) = \\mathbf{G} \\cdot c(t)$. In other words, $\\mathbf{G}$ is the matrix that \"undo\" what $\\gamma_i$s do to $s(t)$. With all these parameters sorted out, we finally come to the actual optimization problem:\n",

    "just as during spatial update, we select some units $i$, and update their calcium dynamics $\\mathbf{C}_i$ based on the **error** and the **l1-norm** of the **spikes** $\\mathbf{G}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{C}_i$. Again it does not make sense to have negative calcium dynamics or spikes so that is our constraint on the problem. Again we need an $\\alpha$ to balance our weight on fidelity and sparsity, which can be scaled up and down with `sparse_penal`, with `sparse_penal=1` equivalent to the default behavior of CaImAn. Again $\\alpha$ should depend on the expected level of noise. Note that we cannot use `sn_spatial` since we need the noise for each unit, not each pixel. Thus we have to calculate it again. `update_temporal` do that for you -- you just have to tell it the `noise_freq`uency. Again **0.5** is the highest you can go and the default `noise_freq=0.25` means the higher frequency half of the signal will be considered noise. In addition to affecting the estimation of noise power, `noise_freq` affect another smoothing process: when we were estimating $\\gamma_i$s using the autocovariance of the signal, it is usually helpful to run a filter on the signal to get rid of all the high freqeuency noise, especially when you don't have large `add_lag` and the estimation can be easily biased by random noise. `noise_freq` is the cut-off frequency of the low-pass filter that run on the temporal trace for each unit, and you can pass in `use_smooth` to control whether to do the filtering at all. Finally even with all these careful design on the problem, it is sometimes hard to approach the true solution. When that happens `update_temporal` will warn you about it by saying something like \"problem solved sub-optimally\". Usually a few of those warnings is OK, but if you see that a lot it means you either have some unreasonable parameters or you need more iterations to approach the real answer. You can use `max_iters` to control how many iterations to run for each small problem before the computer gave up and throw a warning. Furthermore, in some very, very rare cases, the default [ecos solver](https://www.cvxpy.org/tutorial/advanced/index.html#choosing-a-solver) (the algorithm that does all the heavy-lifting) can fail and throw a \"problem infeasible\" warning, and it's worth trying a different solver, namely [scs](https://www.cvxpy.org/tutorial/advanced/index.html#choosing-a-solver) which would produce result with very, very slow performance. The boolean parameter `scs_fallback` controls whether the scs attempt should be made before giving up. Note that both increasing `max_iters` and using `scs_fallback` will significantly increase the computation time and will not help at all if the parameters you provided are unreasonable to begin with, so try to use this only as a last resort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, after the optimization are done, just like [`update_spatial`](#first-spatial-update), we have a `zero_thres` to get rid of the small numbers, after which we can do a `post_scal` to counter the artifacts introduced by **l1-norm** penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "`update_temporal` takes in `Y`, `A`, `b`, `C`, `f`, and `sn_spatial` (even if we won't need it by default), in that order. Optionally you can pass in `noise_freq`, `p`, `add_lag`, `jac_thres`, `use_spatial`, `sparse_penal`, `max_iters`, `use_smooth`, `scs_fallback`, `zero_thres` and `post_scal` as we have discussed. `update_temporal` returns much more than we expected -- in addition to `C_temporal` and `S_temporal`, which is the result we care about, it also give you `YrA`, and `g_temporal` which is the $\\mathbf{G}$ matrix for each unit. Moreover there are `B_temporal`, `C0_temporal` and `sig_temporal`, which is the final layer of complexity: when we update the temporal trace, there might be a global baseline calcium concentration, which is modeled by $b$ and returned in `B_temporal`. There might also be a spike that happened right before recording starts and is still decaying in the first few seconds, so we model this with an initial calcium concentration $c_0$ that follows the same decaying pattern defined by $\\gamma_i$s, and is returned in `C0_temporal`. Both $b$ and $c_0$ is a single number that gets updated along with the calcium dynamics for each unit. Finally there is `sig_temporal` which is the combination of all the signals, that is: `C_temporal + C0_temporal + B_temporal`"

The resulting video will have four parts - top left is the **Raw Video** `minian['org']`; Top right is the **Processed Video** `minian['Y']` (that is, after pre-processing and motion correction); Bottom left is the **Residule**, that is **Raw Video** - **Units**.
